## üìä Project Overview

The **House Price Analysis** project leverages Python to analyze and visualize house prices. It provides insights into how different factors like the number of rooms, location, and size of the house impact its price.

### Key Features:

- **Correlation Analysis**: See how various features such as house size, rooms, and price are correlated.
- **Distribution of House Prices**: Visualize how house prices are distributed across the dataset.
- **Price by Location**: Compare house prices across different locations using box plots.
- **House Size vs. Price**: Explore the relationship between house size and price using scatter plots.
- **Total Price by Location**: Understand the total sales volume for houses in different locations.
- **Year Built vs. Price**: Discover how house prices have changed over the years.
